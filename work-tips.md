## Work tips:

Tone of asking —> do not just ask a question, but also the reason behind the question when it is a slack message.
Example: “Did you do this, I am asking because I am looking into the same thing now and have some follow up questions”
Helps in reducing stress to the reader.

Write emojis, to have a pleasant feel for conversation

Appreciate —> slack message - like / comment
PR —> appreciate
Appreciate in the channel what you found interesting, or a good practice someone did
Appreciate the junior / seniors alike. We are all humans and all like appreciation
PR language. Use team specific options —> ‘let’s do it like this’ rather than ‘do it like this’. More like a polite way. Or ‘can you please do this instead’?
Also, write an explanation why you think your changes are necessary. You need to tell the person why your way should be considered. Else it will be like if it works then why not leave it like the way I wrote it.

Encourage everyone to participate. Some need more time to participate and review, so PR review should also be enabled and treated like story points / work

Stick to your commitments, however small they are. —> helps in building trust! Even if it were just promising someone to have lunch with them some time.
Move tickets on time
Post updates or follow up with conversations —> when someone asks you a question
Be a listener, not just wanting everyone to listen to you. Let others lead, enable them to.
Apologise your mistakes in public —> people will then learn that everyone can do mistakes and there is room for error
