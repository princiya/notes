Prototype Updates

08.10.2018
- Last week: More research on the data justice project with researchers from Tilburg, Netherlands (I am collaborating my project Lightbeam with these researchers to import tracking data from users from different parts of the world and understand the tracking behaviour and patterns)
- This week: Finalising the visualisations for the community based platform, Talking to folks from Mozilla to get inputs on pros and cons in making the above data set public
- Blockers: None

15.10.2018
Last week: Finalised visualisations for research on web tracking, communication with Mozilla folks and understood pros and cons of making the web tracking data public
This week: Implementing the first view for import data and plotting on the graph
Blockers: none

22.10.2018
last week: started working on the initial data import feature for Lightbeam, was a bit sick as well
this week: I will continue on that
and the best thing: I received my first payment for September from Prototype

29.10.2018
Last week*:
--------------
- import data feature (work in progress)
- deciding on the data structure format
- world map view from d3.js
- slides preparation and talk rehearsal for HolyJS (happening on nov 24 in moscow). I am speaking about Lightbeam

*This week*:
-------------
- create pull request for import data
- map points from imported data location onto the world map view
- sync with researchers from Tilburg and get feedback for the feature
- concept design for the UI

05.11.2018
Last week*
-------------
- given that I am working 50% of my time only on this project, I had few cycles to spare and did not get much things done
- but I did realise that the UI needs lot of polishing and the concept has to be thought throughÂ 
- also, we have decided to roll out the features that I build during these 6 month period to be launched as a separate browser extension in the firefox addon store, once we have positive feedback from the test users and community to integrate back into the main web extension

*This week*:
-------------
- concept design
- figure out the process to release a web extension in firefox addon store
- hopefully first data import feature to be liveÂ ðŸ¤žÂ 
- code polishing and refactoring

12.11.2018
We decided to have the import feature as a standalone application and not integrate it in the web extension for the following reasons:

- Importing data from multiple datasets can implode the browser local storage
- Only researchers are likely to use this feature and not daily users

We decided not to host this application anywhere mainly because we do not want the datasets to be transmitted over internet and potentially misused.

*Last week*
-----------

- Import datasets into Lightbeam almost ready as a standalone application
- Quick sneak peek demo -Â http://g.recordit.co/ODnZsFoY7f.gif

*This week*
------------

- Get feedback from Tilburg researchers for the import dataset feature
- Decide to work on next steps based on the feedback and help them setup this application

*Blockers*
-----------

- Time is too short and I have so many things to do!Â 

19.11.2018

*Last week*
-----------

- Import Lightbeam datasets as a standalone web application running using Node.js and Express
- Github repository Â https://github.com/princiya/lightbeam-import
- HolyJS talk rehearsal, slides completed

*This week*
------------

- Speak at HolyJS, Moscow on 24th November about Lightbeam
- Bug fixes for the import feature
- Brainstorm additional enhancements
- UI concept for the clock metaphor diagram to visualise third party trackers

*Extras*
------------

- The 6 month funding time period comprised of 2 parts - research and new enhancements
- I am very happy that the research part is almost done, now mainly waiting to gather research insights and present some mind-blowing analytics
- The remainder of this time will go into enhancing Lightbeamâ€™s visualisation capabilities
26.11.2018
