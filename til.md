# Today I Learned

## 17.08.2021

I have been trying to come up with ideas for a post which lists common scenarios in FE development to use mathematical concepts. Google search landed me to usage of [trigonometry in CSS & Javascript](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/06/02/trigonometry-in-css-and-javascript-getting-creative-with-trigonometric-functions/). The post led me to read more about its author [Michelle](https://michellebarker.co.uk/). I have bookmarked her website for landing page inspiration.

Michelle also maintains [CSS in real life website](https://css-irl.info/). This website has a blogroll section, which I find it to be very cool. Her post on [generating SVG characters](https://css-irl.info/creating-generative-svg-characters/) caught my interest. This led me to learn more about generative art, George Francis's work and his post on [quadtree layouts](https://georgefrancis.dev/writing/generative-grid-layouts-with-quadtrees/).
